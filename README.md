## Summary
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) often involve complex networks of interconnected software and hardware components that are logically combined to achieve a common goal or mission, for example, keeping a plane on the air or providing energy to a city. Failures on these components may jeopardise the mission of the system. Therefore, identifying the minimal set of critical CPS components that is most likely to fail and prevent the global system from delivering its mission becomes essential to ensure reliability.

LDA4CPS is a Java-based tool, built on top of [META4ICS](https://github.com/mbarrere/meta4ics), that has been designed to identify the *most likely mission-critical component set (MLMCS)* using *AND/OR dependency graphs* enriched with *independent failure probabilities*. We address the problem from a logical satisfiability perspective, more specifically, as a Weighted Partial MaxSAT problem. Probabilities are translated into a negative logarithmic space in order to linearise the problem within MaxSAT.

The identification of MLMCS in cyber-physical systems provides support to reason about the strength of a systemâ€™s design.
Therefore, LDA4CPS can be used to help automate the evaluation of potential designs over a space of different system configurations.
We study the robustness of a mission design from a dependency analysis point of view.
The tool includes examples of aircraft dependency models using AND/OR graphs and failure probabilities.
While the examples are mostly focused on complex aircraft systems, LDA4CPS is abstract enough to deal with AND/OR graph-based models representing other kinds of mission-critical cyber-physical systems.


## Requirements
* Java 8
* Python 2/3
* Optional: Python 3, PuLP, and Gurobi to enable second MaxSAT solver

## Usage

1. ```java -jar lda4cps.jar inputFile.json [-c configFile]```  
This command executes LDA4CPS with an input JSON file that describes the dependency network under analysis.

2. ```./web-viewer.py```  
This command launches the webviewer (Python-based HTTP server) that displays the AND/OR graph as well as the most likely critical set.
By default, the webviewer reads the file *view/sol.json* and displays it at [http://localhost:8000/viz.html](http://localhost:8000/viz.html)

### Aircraft system - Case 2

System upgrades. A natural use of the proposed metric is to make decisions based on the identified critical components. This scenario (case 2) shows an hypothetical case where both elevator surfaces *LH* and *LR* have been upgraded and now have a lower failure probability (0.001).

### Aircraft system - Case 3

Understanding whether the mission can still be fulfilled under the presence of failures is vital during design stages. Our approach can easily model failed components *v* by simply considering *p(v) = 1.0*. This scenario (case 3) involves a what-if situation where two different actuators (*PA3* and *PA4*) have failed due to freezing conditions.

## Configuration parameters
The configuration parameters are stored in the file `lda4cps.conf`.
The tool also accepts a different configuration file as argument [-c configFile] to override the configuration in *lda4cps.conf*. If the file `lda4cps.conf` is not present, LDA4CPS uses the default configuration values (see below).

### Solvers
* ```solvers.sat4j = true``` Enables/disables default MaxSAT solver (*default=true*)
* ```solvers.optim = false``` Enables/disables second Gurobi-based MaxSAT solver (*default=false*)

### Python environment
* ```python.path = /usr/local/bin/python3``` Specifies the path to the Python 3 binary (only used with the second [optional] Gurobi-based solver).
* ```python.solver.path = python/optim.py``` Specifies the path to the Gurobi-based solver.

### Output flags
* ```output.sol = true``` Indicates LDA4CPS to output the JSON solution with the critical nodes.
* ```output.wcnf = false``` Enables/disables the specification of the problem in WCNF (DIMACS-like) format (*default=false*). The WCNF file can be used to experiment with other MaxSAT solvers.
* ```output.txt = false``` Enables/disables the specification of the problem in a simple list-based representation file (*default=false*).


### Output folders
* ```folders.output = output``` Specifies the default output folder for *.wcnf* and *.txt* files.
